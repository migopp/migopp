# About Me

I go by a bunch of stuff—most people just call me Michael.

I'm a first-year college student from North Texas—born and raised. I'm a—fairly opinionated—Mac user, and, outside of academics, I like cats, the number 28, and lofi hip-hop, among lots of other random things. During my free time, I enjoy card games with friends, video games (of which, Bioshock is my all-time favorite), and cs + math content.

I'm Turing Scholar at the University of Texas at Austin.
